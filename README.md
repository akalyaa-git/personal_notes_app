# Troubleshooting
* If you encounter any issues, here are some common solutions:

- Firebase Initialization Issues:

Make sure you have correctly added your Firebase configuration files (google-services.json or GoogleService-Info.plist) and initialized Firebase in the app.

Follow the official Firebase setup guide.

- Authentication Errors:

Ensure the Firebase Authentication method (Email/Password or Google Sign-In) is enabled in the Firebase Console.

Check if the email and password meet Firebase requirements (e.g., minimum password length).

- Firestore Errors:

Ensure that you have set the correct Firestore rules for read/write access.

If you are using Firestore on a real device, check if Firestore is initialized correctly.


# Notes:
* Make sure to replace the Firebase configuration details and other URLs with your actual repository and Firebase project info.
* You can also customize the features, future enhancements, or troubleshooting steps based on your appâ€™s unique needs.
